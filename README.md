🎉 Hello and welcome to **Live Scripting 2D**  
plugin for Intellij IDEA and Android Studio !  
 
💥 Turn your favorite IDE into simple realtime interactive Kotlin 2D graphics coding toy !  
  
😎 It is about interactive and simple Kotlin programming of 2D graphics, animations and mini-games.  
  
😍 No more technical buzz like build, package, deploy, no classpath configs, no dependencies management, no command line arguments, etc.  
  
👍 Just write your code (in your favourite IDE) and immediately see 2D graphics results your code produces (automatically recompiled after any modification).  
  
👌 Dynamically parametrize your scripts by GUI sliders, mouse movements and keyboard events.  
  
Use **ready-to-use template** or **examples** below to create your own amazing scripts !

**Development tips and tricks 😀👌**  
  
**1\. Working with script bindings**  
  
**bindings** is a special variable of **javax.script.Bindings** type (extends **Map<String, Object>**) and it is available in script **as is** by default.  
  
**bindings** variable is red highlighted in the code editor as unresolved reference, it is OK and expected behaviour.  
  
To work with bindings more comfortable way use the following sentence to **explicitly define typed variable** for bindings:  
  

    **val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings**

Basic code snippet to get all important values every script **should** do:  
  

    // Bindings variable stores script context map (script state)
    // Below are some key variables every script should get to work properly

    **val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings**

    // Get autoincrement counters for animation purposes
    // Counter steps are: 1, 0.1 and 0.01

    **val counter1 = binds\["counter1"\] as Int
    val counter01 = binds\["counter01"\] as Float
    val counter001 = binds\["counter001"\] as Float**

    // Get slider values from the bindings map
    // Slider values are dynamically changed parameters
    // for your scripts for different animation purposes

    **val sliderRed = binds\["sliderRed"\] as Int
    val sliderGreen = binds\["sliderGreen"\] as Int
    val sliderBlue = binds\["sliderBlue"\] as Int
    val sliderYellow = binds\["sliderYellow"\] as Int**

    // Get mouse position from the bindings map

    **val mousePos = binds\["mousePos"\] as Point**

    // Get Graphics2D instance from the bindings map
    // All subsequent drawings will be done via Graphics2D instance
    // Graphics2D is a key thing for any drawings your script do

    **val graph = binds\["graphics2d"\] as Graphics2D**

    // Get Image instances of sprites from the bindings map
    // There are 7 default built-in images available

    **val imgApple = binds\["imageApple"\] as Image
    val imgStar = binds\["imageStar"\] as Image
    val imgFlower = binds\["imageFlower"\] as Image
    val imgDiamond = binds\["imageDiamond"\] as Image
    val imgBall = binds\["imageBall"\] as Image
    val imgSmile = binds\["imageSmile"\] as Image
    val imgWall = binds\["imageWall"\] as Image**

    // Get keyboard events from the bindings map
    // Use "keyXXX" as binding key name to get key press boolean status value,
    // where XXX is Q, W, ..., 1, 2, ..., Space, Enter, PageUp, etc.

    **val keyQ = binds\["keyQ"\] as Boolean
    val keyW = binds\["keyW"\] as Boolean
    val key1 = binds\["key1"\] as Boolean
    val key2 = binds\["key2"\] as Boolean
    val keySpace = binds\["keySpace"\] as Boolean
    val keyEnter = binds\["keyEnter"\] as Boolean
    val keyUp = binds\["keyUp"\] as Boolean
    val keyDown = binds\["keyDown"\] as Boolean**

👍 You can watch bindings in realtime using plugin's watches panel.

**2\. Working with script state**  
  
Script state is any information your script stores between animation cycles.  
  
Script state stored in the **bindings** map as well.  
  
Here are two examples of working with state:  
  
● Working with single instance in the script state via bindings  
  

    // Bindings variable stores script context map (script state)
    // Explicitly define typed variable for bindings:

    **val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings**

    // Init and get Point instance from the bindings map
    // If "point" key exists in the map, Point instance will be returned
    // If there is no "point" key in the map, Point instance
    // will be created (in the lambda) and returned as well

    **val point = binds.getOrPut("point") {
        Point()
    } as Point**

    // ...your code to modify point's x and y fields...

● Working with list of instances in the script state via bindings  
  

    // Bindings variable stores script context map (script state)
    // Explicitly define typed variable for bindings:

    **val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings**

    // Init and get list of Point instances from the bindings map
    // If "points" key exists in the map, list of Point instances will be returned
    // If there is no "points" key in the map, list of Point instances
    // will be created (in the lambda) and returned as well

    **val points = binds.getOrPut("points") {
        MutableList(size = 35) { Point() }
    } as MutableList<Point>**

    // ...your code to modify list of points...

👍 You can watch script state (as part of the bindings) in realtime using plugin's watches panel.
