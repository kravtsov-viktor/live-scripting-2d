    <!--b>Привет ! Добро пожаловать ! 😍😍</b-->
    🎉 Hello and welcome to <b>Live Scripting 2D</b><br>plugin for Intellij IDEA and Android Studio !
    <br><br>💥 Turn your favorite IDE into simple realtime interactive Kotlin 2D graphics coding toy !
    <br><br>😎 It is about interactive and simple Kotlin programming of 2D graphics, animations and mini-games.
    <br><br>😍 No more technical buzz like build, package, deploy, no classpath configs, no dependencies
    management, no command line arguments, etc.
    <br><br>👍 Just write your code (in your favourite IDE) and immediately see 2D graphics results your code produces
    (automatically recompiled after any modification).
    <br><br>👌 Dynamically parametrize your scripts by GUI sliders, mouse movements and keyboard events.
    <br><br>Use <b>ready-to-use template</b> or <b>examples</b> below to create your own amazing scripts !

    type info, members list, etc.)
    <br>

    <br><b>2. Realtime interactivity and optimal experience 👍</b>
    <br><br>● Type your code and see the results immediately recompiled in a few seconds !<br>
    <br>● Parametrize your scripts by GUI sliders, mouse movements and keyboard events !<br>
    <br>● Short circuit mind attention feedback between taken efforts and
    the results obtained.
    <br>

<p style="font-family: system-ui; font-size: 17px;"><b>Development tips and tricks 😀👌</b>
    <br><br><b>1. Working with script bindings</b>
    <br><br><b>bindings</b> is a special variable of <b>javax.script.Bindings</b> type (extends <b>Map&lt;String, Object&gt;</b>) and
    it is available in script <b>as is</b> by default.
    <br><br><b>bindings</b> variable is red highlighted in the code editor as unresolved reference, it is OK and expected behaviour.
    <br><br>To work with bindings more comfortable way use the following sentence to <b>explicitly define typed variable</b>
    for bindings:
    <br><br>
<pre style="font-size: 14px;">
    <b>val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings</b></pre>

<p style="font-family: system-ui; font-size: 17px;">Basic code snippet to get all important values every script <b>should</b>
    do:
    <br><br>
<pre style="font-size: 14px;">
    // Bindings variable stores script context map (script state)
    // Below are some key variables every script should get to work properly

    <b>val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings</b>

    // Get autoincrement counters for animation purposes
    // Counter steps are: 1, 0.1 and 0.01

    <b>val counter1 = binds["counter1"] as Int
    val counter01 = binds["counter01"] as Float
    val counter001 = binds["counter001"] as Float</b>

    // Get slider values from the bindings map
    // Slider values are dynamically changed parameters
    // for your scripts for different animation purposes

    <b>val sliderRed = binds["sliderRed"] as Int
    val sliderGreen = binds["sliderGreen"] as Int
    val sliderBlue = binds["sliderBlue"] as Int
    val sliderYellow = binds["sliderYellow"] as Int</b>

    // Get mouse position from the bindings map

    <b>val mousePos = binds["mousePos"] as Point</b>

    // Get Graphics2D instance from the bindings map
    // All subsequent drawings will be done via Graphics2D instance
    // Graphics2D is a key thing for any drawings your script do

    <b>val graph = binds["graphics2d"] as Graphics2D</b>

    // Get Image instances of sprites from the bindings map
    // There are 7 default built-in images available

    <b>val imgApple = binds["imageApple"] as Image
    val imgStar = binds["imageStar"] as Image
    val imgFlower = binds["imageFlower"] as Image
    val imgDiamond = binds["imageDiamond"] as Image
    val imgBall = binds["imageBall"] as Image
    val imgSmile = binds["imageSmile"] as Image
    val imgWall = binds["imageWall"] as Image</b>

    // Get keyboard events from the bindings map
    // Use "keyXXX" as binding key name to get key press boolean status value,
    // where XXX is Q, W, ..., 1, 2, ..., Space, Enter, PageUp, etc.

    <b>val keyQ = binds["keyQ"] as Boolean
    val keyW = binds["keyW"] as Boolean
    val key1 = binds["key1"] as Boolean
    val key2 = binds["key2"] as Boolean
    val keySpace = binds["keySpace"] as Boolean
    val keyEnter = binds["keyEnter"] as Boolean
    val keyUp = binds["keyUp"] as Boolean
    val keyDown = binds["keyDown"] as Boolean</b></pre>
</p>

<p style="font-family: system-ui; font-size: 17px;">👍 You can watch bindings in realtime using plugin's watches panel.</p>

<p style="font-family: system-ui; font-size: 17px;"><b>2. Working with script state</b>
    <br><br>Script state is any information your script stores between animation cycles.
    <br><br>Script state stored in the <b>bindings</b> map as well.

    <br><br>Here are two examples of working with state:

    <br><br>● Working with single instance in the script state via bindings

    <br><br>
<pre style="font-size: 14px;">
    // Bindings variable stores script context map (script state)
    // Explicitly define typed variable for bindings:

    <b>val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings</b>

    // Init and get Point instance from the bindings map
    // If "point" key exists in the map, Point instance will be returned
    // If there is no "point" key in the map, Point instance
    // will be created (in the lambda) and returned as well

    <b>val point = binds.getOrPut("point") {
        Point()
    } as Point</b>

    // ...your code to modify point's x and y fields...</pre>

<p style="font-family: system-ui; font-size: 17px;">● Working with list of instances in the script state via bindings
    <br><br>
<pre style="font-size: 14px;">
    // Bindings variable stores script context map (script state)
    // Explicitly define typed variable for bindings:

    <b>val binds = bindings as javax.script.Bindings</b>

    // Init and get list of Point instances from the bindings map
    // If "points" key exists in the map, list of Point instances will be returned
    // If there is no "points" key in the map, list of Point instances
    // will be created (in the lambda) and returned as well

    <b>val points = binds.getOrPut("points") {
        MutableList(size = 35) { Point() }
    } as MutableList&lt;Point&gt;</b>

    // ...your code to modify list of points...</pre>

</p>

<p style="font-family: system-ui; font-size: 17px;">👍 You can watch script state (as part of the bindings) in realtime using plugin's watches panel.</p>
